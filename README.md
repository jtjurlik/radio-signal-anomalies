# Anomaly Prediction in Smart Energy Management Systems

Contains code notebooks used to perform data science experiments for my Master's thesis, "Anomaly Prediction in Smart Energy Management Systems: A Neural Network-based Comparison".

The experiment included 1) data pre-processing, 2) feature engineering, 3) tuning of CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, and ConvLSTM architectures, and 4) forecasting evaluation on all data and anomaly data only.

Feature engineering notebook has been excluded due to confidentiality of the data used for this step.

Elements of the tuning and training pipeline are also included as separate python files in the 'pipeline' folder.
